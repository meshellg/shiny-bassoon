title: 2022 - November 9 - What we are working on - Mesopotamia
category: homeschooling
---

Well, I really fell off updating this, but that's okay, we were keeping busy. We've sort of hit our stride with schooling and I think it's going well.

No recaps, but today we're focusing on Mesopotamia which is Chapter 3 in Curiosity Chronicals. We've built the notebook pages with a map of Mesopotamia, learned about the Tigris & Euphraties rivers, and the impact of Agriculture and Hearding on the development of Civilization.

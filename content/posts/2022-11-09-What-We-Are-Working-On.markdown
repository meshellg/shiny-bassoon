title: 2022 - November 9 - What we are working on - Mesopotamia
category: homeschooling
---

Well, I really fell off updating this, but that's okay, we were keeping busy. We've sort of hit our stride with schooling and I think it's going well.

No recaps, but today we're focusing on Mesopotamia which is Chapter 3 in Curiosity Chronicals. We've built the notebook pages with a map of Mesopotamia, learned about the Tigris & Euphraties rivers, and the impact of Agriculture and Hearding on the development of Civilization.

**Reference Materials**

- We're using Curiosity Chronicals as our base curriculum.
- We read a few pages from [Ancient Mesopotamia Inside Out by Ellen Rodger](https://crabtreebooks.com/shop/show/12853) which is also available [online](https://toronto.overdrive.com/media/3245149) through the Toronto Public Library.
- [Khan Academy - Ancient Mesopotamia](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history/world-history-beginnings/ancient-mesopotamia/v/ancient-mesopotamia)
- We used this map to help identify the various important parts of the area, and [the kid also coloured a map of mesopotamia](https://www.worldhistory.org/image/169/map-of-the-fertile-crescent/)

And finally, we did our nature journalling which led to some great conversations about properties of water (we found some ice!), pressure, atmosphere, the impact on the weather, and what the difference  between gravity and atmosopheric pressure is.

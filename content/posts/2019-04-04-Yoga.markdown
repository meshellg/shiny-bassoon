I've tried to do yoga a few times in my life. The practice appealed to me, but I didn't make or have the time for consistency.
A girlfriend and I took a community center series for a month or two, and then never again.
I was more consistent with my practice during pregnancy because I found it made me feel very good, and it was a great way to make sure I moved my body in an intentional way while pregnant, especially as we approached the due date.

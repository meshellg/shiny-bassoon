Today my adventure began bright and early. I went downtown (by myself) to take part in the Sunrise Ceremony at the [IRSS Legacy Celebration](https://irsslegacy.com/) at Nathan Phillips Square. I was late arriving and stood back and watched, I think I could have joined in. I probably should have, but felt uncomfortable and disrespectful about being late for it. (I have this thing with time.)

But it felt meaningful and with intention, as a fairly large group gathered to acknowledge the day. Tkaronto was projected on the left tower of City Hall. 







I met my partner at his office, picked up the small human, and we went back to City Hall to take in some of the programming. And I wanted to vote in the advanced polls that started today. We got it all done.







The kiddo was a hit at the polling area, and was excited to participate in a process we've talked about a bit. There was also a Daniel Tiger episode about voting for swings or a slide, and voting for a class pet ( a bunny or a turtle ) so the process of selection has been touched on in a variety of ways already.







He watched me fill in my ballot, and asked me what I was doing - I told him I was selecting the person who I thought would do the best possible job. 







A friend met us with their kiddo, and we got to watch a Lacrosse demonstration from The Toronto Rock, and admire some of artistry of the commemorative teepees and play in the adjoining open spaces. 







And my favourite part of the day - watching our kids play together.













There is nothing better than that.

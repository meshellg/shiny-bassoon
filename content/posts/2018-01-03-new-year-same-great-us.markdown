Yesterday morning we bundled up and got ready for the YMCA. It's become a regular thing, this guaranteed Tuesday morning visit to the Y - why? Because we have a regular cleaner now, and it's nice to get out of the house and get out of their way. I'd rather spend time with the TinyHuman than spend anymore time organizing, cleaning, scrubbing, over and over and over again, Instead, we leave, and come back to a nicely organized, clean house - then it's nap time, and I get to take care of dinner things or read books or watch movies or some combination of those. They've been coming for approximately 1 month, and It has been really really nice.

The Tinyhuman seems to like his visits to the YMCA - I take him over to the childminding folks (that don't particularly like me - but they do like him, which is all that matters) and I get some time to run or weight lift or aquafit. Then I scoop up the kiddo and we go swimming together - something he really seems to love too.

A few things I've started to encourage in the house are random spontaneous dance parties. I'll turn on a song on our Sonos, and declare a dance party, and go to the centre of the living room and dance. This will invariably (so far) encourage other members of the family to join me. It's a fun break to occasionally sedentary time at home, while also encouraging silliness, laughter, and getting our heart rates up a bit.

title: Book Riot's 2019 Read Harder Challenge

I did BookRiot's 2018 Read Harder Challenge, and it got me out of my usual genres and connected me with books I really loved that weren't ones I would have picked up.

After our Tinyhuman was born, I had a really challenging time focusing on books for the first year or two, but in 2018, I managed to read over 40 books, at least in part as a result of the ReadHarderChallenge, but also just because my focus came back.

I don't plan on getting too intense about checking off boxes that don't excite me, but the newest challenge has been released, and I am getting into it again.

To get organized for next year, I've to started collecting some suggestions here, if you've any recommendations for me, I'd love to hear them!

You can see my collection of 2019 ReadHarder books on GoodReads, arranged in no particular order [right here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/2388071-michelle?shelf=read-harder-2019).

I am lucky that most of these are available from the Toronto Public Library, and even luckier that many of them are available as e-books which has been my favourite and most effective way to get some read done. (And certainly makes it easier to read anywhere - when a selection of books is available right on my cellphone.)

(p.s. this list is still a work in progress)


## **Read Harder 2019**





 	
  1. ** An epistolary novel or collection of letters**

 	
    * Microserfs - Douglas Coupland

 	
      * I picked this book up several years ago (2015?) during the ROM's Douglas Coupland installation, and it's been on my "to read" list ever since.




 	
    * Letters to a Young Poet, Ranier Maria Rilke

 	
      * Someone mentioned this book was very inspiring to them, so I wanted to check it out.







 	
  2. **An alternate history novel**

 	
    * Naughts & Crosses by Malorie Blackman

 	
      * I've gotten really excited about this genre and there is not nearly enough out there. Two young people are forced to make a stand in this thought-provoking look at racism and prejudice in an alternate society. Sephy is a Cross -- a member of the dark-skinned ruling class. Callum is a Nought -- a “colourless” member of the underclass who were once slaves to the Crosses.







 	
  3. **A book by a woman and/or AOC (Authour of Colour) that won a literary award in 2018**

 	
    * Decent into the Night by Edem Awumey (Winner of the [Governor Generals Literary Award](https://ggbooks.ca/descent-into-night), written in French by a male authour of colour and translated by a woman.)

 	
    * Washington Black by Esi Edugyan (winner of the 2018 [Giller Prize](https://scotiabankgillerprize.ca/esi-dugyan-winner-2018-scotiabank-giller-prize/), Esi is also a woman authour of colour.)

  6. **A book by an Authour of Colour set in or about space**

 	
    * Dawn by Octavia Butler

 	
      * I've been working through the work of Octavia Butler, because it is all excellent, so this one was inevitable, but fits the category.

  9. **A book published prior to January 1, 2019, with fewer than 100 reviews on Goodreads**

 	
    * Split Tooth by Tanya Tagaq.

 	
      * this sort of feels like cheating again, but this has been on my list since it was published, and it doesn't have many reviews, but I want to read it either way.

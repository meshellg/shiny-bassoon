title: Book Riot's 2019 Read Harder Challenge
category:

---

I did BookRiot's 2018 Read Harder Challenge, and it got me out of my usual genres and connected me with books I really loved that weren't ones I would have picked up.

After our Tinyhuman was born, I had a really challenging time focusing on books for the first year or two, but in 2018, I managed to read over 40 books, at least in part as a result of the ReadHarderChallenge, but also just because my focus came back.

I don't plan on getting too intense about checking off boxes that don't excite me, but the newest challenge has been released, and I am getting into it again.

To get organized for next year, I've to started collecting some suggestions here, if you've any recommendations for me, I'd love to hear them!

You can see the post from [bookriot here](https://bookriot.com/2018/12/12/2019-read-harder-challenge/).

You can see my collection of 2019 ReadHarder books on GoodReads, arranged in no particular order [right here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/2388071-michelle?shelf=read-harder-2019).

I am lucky that most of these are available from the Toronto Public Library, and even luckier that many of them are available as e-books which has been my favourite and most effective way to get some read done. (And certainly makes it easier to read anywhere - when a selection of books is available right on my cellphone.)

(p.s. this list is still a work in progress)


## **Read Harder 2019**

  1. ** An epistolary novel or collection of letters**
    * I capture the Castle by Dodie Smith

    * ✔ Ella Minnow Pea by Mark Dunn

  2. **An alternate history novel**
    * ✔ Naughts & Crosses by Malorie Blackman
      * I've gotten really excited about this genre and there is not nearly enough out there. Two young people are forced to make a stand in this thought-provoking look at racism and prejudice in an alternate society. Sephy is a Cross -- a member of the dark-skinned ruling class. Callum is a Nought -- a “colourless” member of the underclass who were once slaves to the Crosses.
      * I read this book and have a mixed feeling about it. The story was so interesting and compelling in the beginning, and then it felt like it sort of fizzled out by the end.

  4. **A humour book**
    * ✔ This Is Just My Face: Try Not to Stare

  6. **A book by an Authour of Colour set in or about space**

        * really enjoyed this one, super cozy mystery. I was a bit surprised at a few instances of casual ablism. It was written in 2008, and I don't think the r-word was okay back then either. I'd probably read more from the Booktown series though.

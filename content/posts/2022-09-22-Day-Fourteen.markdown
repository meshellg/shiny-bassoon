**Week 7**

I've found it kind of fascinating how much easier it is to start the day with a craft. It's maybe obvious to experienced educators, but having that point to pivot from is a great way to get into the "it's time for school mindset"

We have landed into a rhythm, but one that also doesn't feel too intense, but still is somewhat academically rigorous.

We are using a combination of the following:
- Torchlight 0,1 (General Curriculum)
- BuildYourLibrary 0,1 (General Curriculum)
- Curiosity Chronicals - Snapshots of Ancient History (History)
- Beast Math Level 1 (Math)
- Building Foundations for Scientific Understanding Vol 1 (Science)
- Be Naturally Curious (Science Unit Studies)

One of the things I've been considering is Science Connection through Inquiry, which is based on Building Foundations for Scientific Understanding, but I feel kind of weird using some thing that costs money, that's based on something else, when it doesn't look like the original authour is involved.

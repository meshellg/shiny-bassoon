I was reading a comic I like recently and it made me burst into tears. [How Baby Comic](http://howbabycomic.com/comic/hb322/) talked about an ask reddit thread where people talked about the saddest sentence they could think of, and the author quoted:


<blockquote> "one day, your parents put you down and never picked you back up again."</blockquote>


We are in that zone now, things are shifting away slowly to a different stage, he's ready to be more independent, and I am working on let go. For the first 2 years, he wouldn't hold his bottle by himself, and I was happy to snuggle him anyway. A few months  ago, he started holding it entirely by himself.

Where a few weeks ago, he would still fall asleep on me for his afternoon nap, now he's getting to the point where he wont need us to snuggle him anymore. Sometimes he falls asleep in his own bed, all by himself. These things are bittersweet. I am excited for his journey towards independence, but it's that clear sign that he is growing up and out, and part of me just wants to hold him close as long as I can.

It's been important to us to let him go at his own pace, if he was feeling more independent, we would encourage him, if he was needing more help, I was happy to support him. We play every day by ear, because everyday is different.

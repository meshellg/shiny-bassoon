Reading has never been much of an issue over here. It happened pretty organically, and maybe in part because both of us adults read quite early as well.

But writing has been less of a natural thing - and the use of screens are definitely at fault, compounded by a lack of hand strength and a disinclination towards drawing or colouring. I don't know the source of it, but this year I wanted to work on making that less of a challenge.

So some of the things I've done with the intention of encouraging hand strength building (some of which we were doing before, but now it's very on purpose vs semi-happenstance)

- Rolling, squeezing, and playing with play dough. I've also been providing plasticine some of the time which is a lot tougher to work with than play dough.
- Cutting things out with scissors
- Climbing
- Popping bubble wrap
- Using a single hole holepunch for crafts otherwise.
- Using tongs to pick up things.

And I wish I had done more of these things before, but I also realize that the kid's inclination wasn't there for most of these things - beyond climbing and playing with playdough. I could offer many of the things, and did, but it just wasn't interesting, but I know I could have done more to encourage it. Better late than never I suppose.

One of the other things we've been doing is writing a nature journal, and while I am still the main person writing in it, I think it's helped show more reasons to write that aren't boring.  

Anyway, we've been working with the Grade 1 Handwriting without Tears workbook, and it's been very good. I am likely to pick up the teachers guide soon.

Oh! and we did end up going out first thing in the morning to the pond, sadly/gladly, the over night temps did not reach freezing here so no ice puck.

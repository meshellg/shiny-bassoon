We focused a lot of nature study today which was good for both of us. There is something so spectacular about talking about potions and nature while a belted king fisher swoops down and then swoops away from our pond. He didn't know we were there - until he did and then it was time to go, time to go.

Ideally we'd spend at least half of the day outside, but the inclination comes and goes, and it seems unnecessary to force it on the days the desire to be out is low.

We read more of the Tale of Desperaux, but someone is dragging their feet on it because they don't want it to be over. Secrets revealled. Regardless, I expect we will be finished soon enough.

I've been encouraging more practise with cutting things out, and it's been great. The skills are increasing with time and practise as one might expect - though the skills are developing in a short period of time, at least in part because the fine motor skills are already there to help make it work.

I'm waiting on doing a magnetism unit until we get a few magnets in the mail.

I had ordered a multiplication table from Staples a few weeks ago, and the poster is alot bigger than I expected, but we've been playing mulitplcation games lately, and it's been a lot of fun. Probably a bit big of a jump away from addition and subtraction, but it feels right at the moment.

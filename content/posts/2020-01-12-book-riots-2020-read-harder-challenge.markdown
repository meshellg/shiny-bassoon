title: Book Riot's 2020 Read Harder Challenge
category:
- Books
---

I've done the BookRiot Read Harder Challenge for the last few years and it has helped get me out of my usual genres while also helping me connect with a bunch of fantastic books and keep me looking for new and interesting reads. Sometimes when I'm feeling stuck with a book, it's fun to check my list, and see what else I had wanted to read so I can switch things up.

I completed most of my [ReadHarder 2019 Books](https://tinyhuman.house/posts/book-riots-2019-read-harder-challenge/) with a few exceptions, but one thing I found helpful is having a live document where I could write out some of the books I wanted to read, the categories they fit under, and check them off when or if I completed them. The experience is different versus on GoodReads but I like tracking them on both.

You can see the post from [bookriot here](https://bookriot.com/2019/12/03/2020-read-harder-challenge/) with all of the categories and also with suggestions for many categories. I appreciate that they always have some solid recommendations for each of them, and add more as time passes.

You can see my collection of 2020 ReadHarder books on GoodReads, arranged in no particular order [right here](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/2388071-michelle?shelf=read-harder-2020).

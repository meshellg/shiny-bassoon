**Day Five - September 12th 2022**

- Share [Mythic Book Emporium](https://dreamforge.mywebportal.app/dreamforge/stories/show/mythic-book-emporium-mary-soon-lee) by Mary Soon Lee over breakfast.
- Lesson 2-A BFSU - Solids Liquids and Gases and Change with Temperature
    - An activity classifying things as solids, liquids, or gasses
    - An inquiry on whether and what similarities are observed, how do we differentiate them.
    - Discussion on classifications of states of matter, focusing on solid liquid gas, debating talking about plasma, not debating on Bose-Einstein or any other condensates.
    - Talk about temperature and impact on states of matter.
    - Reading of books related to matter
    - [Let's Talk Science Page on Matter](https://letstalkscience.ca/educational-resources/backgrounders/states-matter)
    - [Try this worksheet](https://www.liveworksheets.com/worksheets/en/Natural_Science/Matter/States_of_matter_mu624210rc)  
    - Check on our Nature Square and collect some observations in our nature journal. (Attempt continuation of high park nature centre lesson)
    - Look at our beans and collect any data we observe.
    - Read more Tale of Desperaux

    -  patterns and counting on. (Starting from the bigger number in addition to make things easier)

**What did we actually do?**
Unfortunately we only really got through the matter lesson, and it turns out the kid knew about plasma and bose einstein condensates from another book he read. I did an activity with different objects in different states of matter, and we talked a lot about lightening.

We did also observe our growing bean sprout and made some observations about the bean differences from sprout to seed.

I'm hoping to get back to the Tale of Desperaux, but it's fallen off the radar somewhat. Curriculum-wise we are still ahead of the plan.

I started my planning process earlier this time around, so there is no scramble to make a plan and also it gave a little time to go along and comment on the week as things happened.


## How did we do with last week's plan?


I think it's worth analyzing how last weeks meal plan worked out as I create this new one. I probably had too many ambitious dishes on the roster for last week, especially when we also had too much stuff on the go with non-food life related things. That will change over the next few weeks, but easier options would be a better idea. We loved the overnight oats/make ahead breakfast options and I loved having prepared jarred lunches to grab for after our son's early afternoon nap.

We have added a wildcard to our week in the form of a CSA. We have some idea of what we're getting earlier in the week, but the resulting meals after delivery might be more impromptu or side dishes.

I did follow through with bagels this morning and they were absolutely excellent, but I think I'm going to aim to do them 1-2 a month rather than every week. Though I've considered the overlap between challah making and other baking - so we'll play that by ear.

The other nice thing about having a plan or just planning some of our meals ahead is that cooking in the evening or early in the morning controls our temperature a little bit - especially as our summer heats up a bit more for the season.

Without further ado, this is what we're planning on making this week;

## Dinner


**Monday or Tuesday.**
[Lentil Loaf](https://www.thespruce.com/vegan-lentil-loaf-recipe-3377145) - some lentil loaf recipes can be really fussy and full of steps and work - Im hoping to find one that is straightforward and easy to put together. This one might just be that recipe. But only time will tell if it's delicious too. With a side of mashed potatoes and a mixed vegetable salad. Make lots of lentils for other dishes throughout the week. Leftover loaf could make a great quick lunch later in the week as well.

I'm planning to make a strawberry rhubarb pie this week. [This crust from smitten kitchen looks lovely,](https://smittenkitchen.com/2008/11/pie-crust-102-all-butter-really-flaky-pie-dough/) but despite her proclamations of the superiority of butter, I will still (obviously) be using Earth Balance.

---

I should start thinking about the weeks ahead during the week before, but we get to Sunday and I remember it's time to put our grocery order in. Grocery order? Well - our local grocer has an online option so someone else picks our groceries for us and we load it into our car.

We just pick them up. This still usually involves a quick run through for items we might have forgotten or to pick up some beer or cider, but generally, it keeps our time there as short as possible. Our little one does not like shopping carts, so one of us ends up carrying him around or occasionally letting him roam the less breakable aisles for a while, which adds to our desire to get in and get out sooner rather than later.

The following are recipes we're planning on making in the coming week, starting on Monday for 2 hungry adults and 1 not-so-picky toddler. Some lunches are for my husband to take to work, but if we can prepare  a few lunches ahead of time all of us will win.

To be honest, many of these aren't all reasonable or simple meals, but many or parts of them can be prepared in advance.

I'm starting the weekend feeling more enthusiastic about savoury items but I like having a few different options in mind. I find having an idea of what we're going to have during the week, makes it a lot easier to make things, and saves me a lot of time searching for the one thing

title: 2022 - Third Day of School
category: homeschooling
---

Day three was a bit challenging, and we almost didn't get through it, but somehow we did. I broke the ice with one of the Bean lifecycle craft/worksheets, and it was pretty positive from there, but the day involved more screen time than the first two days. I figure we'll find out a balance eventually.

- Someone is reading The Life Story here and we're watching them and talking about history: https://youtu.be/I1tGGEZyCH0?t=818 The Life Story Act 2 continued
    - the book (which is a different version than the one being read above) is also available here: https://www.scribd.com/read/367595395/Life-Story (this was cute for the first few acts, but eventually got weird and very pro-settler and ignored Indigenous people or the fact that "discovery" is kind of a silly word to use for a place that already had people in it.
- More pre-history - https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/world-history/world-history-beginnings/origin-humans-early-societies/v/history-and-prehistory  (this one was adamantly declined, but we'll come back to it someday - it's not really for 6 year olds anyway.

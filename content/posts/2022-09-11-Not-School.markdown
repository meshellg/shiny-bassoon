The first weekend after school begins, there is a bit of pressure to keep up the learning and doing and all of that stuff, but we both needed a break from it all.

I spent the morning lounging around in bed until at least 9am, which for unknown reasons felt oddly decadent. Possibly because I think I must have woken up at 7am, and just picked up my e-reader to keep reading Andy Weir's Hail Mary (and eventually finished it during the weekend - very cute book)

We did do some fun things, I've started working on some raised beds and dug into the earth to trench them, but yesterday was also kind of a draining dreary type of day.

---

Another day, another day of school. We're using a few different curriculums, and combining some pieces here and there.

We're sporadically following Build Your Library level 0 and 1, Wild Math 1, Khan Academy Grade 1&2, and a school garden curriculum book.

Today we're doing:
- *How to Make an Apple Pie and See the World*, someone was kind enough to read the whole thing here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w03XWpdfKRE. There is a cute PDF resource from a school available [Here](https://www.lcps.org/cms/lib4/VA01000195/Centricity/Domain/6681/How_to_Make_an_Apple_Pie_and_See_the_World.pdf) if you find yourself doing the same thing.
    - Find the places mentioned in the story on Google Earth.
    - Talk about the ingredients for apple pie that are found all over the world.
    - Talk about how not all of the ingredients in the story are required, and find alternatives for eggs and milk/butter, and go on a virtual adventure to find them all.
    - We looked at this [Bianca Zapatka](http://biancazapatka.com/en/vegan-apple) recipe for vegan Apple Pie, and went on a journey for all the ingredients.
    Wheat (Alberta), Sugar (costa rica), Sea Salt (Newfoundland), Olive Oil (Greece), Apples (Northumberland County, Ontario), Corn Starch (Iowa, USA), Cinnamon (Sri Lanka), Nutmeg (Indonesia), Lemon (India).
    - This story and activity was also a great opportunity to ask for some narration.
    - Zooming out on google earth, lead nicely to the next activity.
- Discus earthâ€™s place in space - solar system.

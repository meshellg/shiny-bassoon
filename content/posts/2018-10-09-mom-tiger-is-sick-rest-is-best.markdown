I've been sick for a few days and I feel bummed out about it - there is so much I'd like to do, and so much I'd rather be doing, but I'm trying to rest as much as possible.











The sad thing is that I'm conscious of how much I'd love to be cleaning or doing laundry or all the things I normally and eagerly set aside - in favour of this deeply exhausted feeling in my muscles.







On the bright side, I am generally able to focus on a book or to attempt sentence construction, so I've been working on some Coursera courses, and have finished a few books in the past few days.Â

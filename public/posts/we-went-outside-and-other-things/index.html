                        <p>The Tinyhuman had a swimming lesson this morning - he went with his dad, and I slept in until the glorious time of 9am. I&rsquo;m getting pretty into these Saturday mornings where I sleep in, and then do some housework while they go play in the pool. In my head, I thought maybe I would start going to the gym, but I end up doing things I have a hard time doing while the kid is at home instead.</p>

<p>Maybe that&rsquo;s fine. It doesn&rsquo;t give me anything in particular to brag about, but I do get it done. I&rsquo;ve been working on a <a href="http://clutterbug.me/2017/09/30-day-decluttering-challenge.html">30 day declutter challenge from Clutterbug</a>, and it&rsquo;s already made a really positive impact on our house. I don&rsquo;t think I ever thought I&rsquo;d become so domesticated.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m hoping we can return to the gym together next week now that most of the signs of his cold have disappeared.Â  I&rsquo;ve so missed Aquafit and I&rsquo;m thinking of doing more weight training on future visits since I used to love it so much.</p>

<p>One thing that was great was putting together another <a href="https://igg.me/at/nrOd-UXu9S8">For The North</a> box while they were at lessons - this one is going to a low income parents support group in one of the Northern provinces/territories. I don&rsquo;t believe in reiki or the like, but i still like to visualize a lot of good energy going into every one of the boxes I pack up. It&rsquo;s been such a thrill to be able to do this. I hope it&rsquo;s helpful.</p>

<p>The almost-1-year old we were matched with under the Northern Birthday Box project got her birthday supplies last week, it&rsquo;s been eye opening to see how expensive things can be for people that live there - boxes of really basic cake mix or icing sold here for 1-2$ are 10-15/box. I&rsquo;ve got a bit of a birthday complex, so it&rsquo;s been deeply satisfying to be able to send people the things the need to celebrate a birthday. We&rsquo;ve done two so far, but now they have more people interested in sending than they have applicants, so the next time is probably far off. I signed up to be a last minute box sender incase someone flakes out.</p>

<p>This weekend we went to a different forest than our usual spot, and explored a little. Our intention was to play in the playground, but wouldn&rsquo;t you know it - the kiddo wanted to run in the trees. No surprise there! He&rsquo;s wearing a new-to-us hoodie from Maxmorra I picked up from a mama on a BST group. I was excited, but he was even more excited, it was so darn cute. He really loves cars. And he was thrilled.</p>

<p>This time of year I&rsquo;m a little at a loss as to what to dress him in - it&rsquo;s kind of cool, windy, rainy, sometimes warm, sometimes wet. Snow makes more sense to me, winter makes more sense. Though we&rsquo;ll see if I&rsquo;m still saying that once January rolls around.</p>

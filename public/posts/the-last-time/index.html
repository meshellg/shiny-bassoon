                        <p>I was reading a comic I like recently and it made me burst into tears. <a href="http://howbabycomic.com/comic/hb322/">How Baby Comic</a> talked about an ask reddit thread where people talked about the saddest sentence they could think of, and the author quoted:</p>

<blockquote> "one day, your parents put you down and never picked you back up again."</blockquote>

<p>We are in that zone now, things are shifting away slowly to a different stage, he&rsquo;s ready to be more independent, and I am working on let go. For the first 2 years, he wouldn&rsquo;t hold his bottle by himself, and I was happy to snuggle him anyway. A few months  ago, he started holding it entirely by himself.</p>

<p>Where a few weeks ago, he would still fall asleep on me for his afternoon nap, now he&rsquo;s getting to the point where he wont need us to snuggle him anymore. Sometimes he falls asleep in his own bed, all by himself. These things are bittersweet. I am excited for his journey towards independence, but it&rsquo;s that clear sign that he is growing up and out, and part of me just wants to hold him close as long as I can.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been important to us to let him go at his own pace, if he was feeling more independent, we would encourage him, if he was needing more help, I was happy to support him. We play every day by ear, because everyday is different.</p>

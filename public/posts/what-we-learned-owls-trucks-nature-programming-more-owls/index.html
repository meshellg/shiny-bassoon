                        <p>Every Wednesday we watch the garbage or recycling  truck from the front window - conveniently we have been reading Digger, Dozer, Dumper, an amazingly fun and wonderful board book with a couple pages focused on a garbage truck.  When we hear the familiar rumble of the waste disposal truck  -  my son looked at me, and I looked at him, and I suggested we go look out the window at what they were doing. He ran to the front window, and stood on his tip toes to peek at them and their big truck. I put him on my shoulders and he was thrilled to see the trucks driving around and the workers picking up our boxes.</p>

<p>As the truck drove away, the Beeboo waved bye bye.</p>

<p>Our next topic was Owls. We have two primary owl books on rotation over here - Owls from Usborne Books, and Owls from National Geographic. Right now the Usborne Owl Book is winning. It has a great overview of Owl body parts, methods of eating, finding a mate, different types of owls, and more. There is a lot of overlap in the information in early reader books about owls, so I know I&rsquo;m learning a lot just by repetition. More than I ever knew I wanted to know.</p>

<p>His interests have now made me pay attention to owl news and events - there was a <a href="https://www.highparknaturecentre.com/ai1ec_event/the-raptors-of-high-park-family-nature-walk/?instance_id=12715">Raptor of High Park</a> event with the <a href="https://www.highparknaturecentre.com/">High Park Nature Centre</a> not too long ago, but had to miss it because it&rsquo;s during prime nap time - but just knowing that they do these kinds of things makes me expect we will catch one of them one day (assuming the Beeboo continues his Owl fandom beyond toddlerhood.)</p>

<p>We are thinking about signing up fro the Nature Centre&rsquo;s Waddlers program. I wonder how we will respond to the structure of it all. Because we love running through the forest on our own, but more of a free form wandering. I feel optimistic. Cautiously optimistic.</p>

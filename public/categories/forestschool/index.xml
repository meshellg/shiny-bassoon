      <description>This morning after my partner left for work, we quickly got ready to get outside and go to the forest nearby. We&amp;rsquo;re lucky to hour our little forest, and I feel grateful to say things like &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s visit our trees&amp;rdquo; on a regular basis.Â There was so much to learn and so much to do. We walked hand in hand for most of the trip to the park, but once we got past the traffic gates I let him go and he asked if he could run.</description>

      <description>The Tinyhuman had a swimming lesson this morning - he went with his dad, and I slept in until the glorious time of 9am. I&amp;rsquo;m getting pretty into these Saturday mornings where I sleep in, and then do some housework while they go play in the pool. In my head, I thought maybe I would start going to the gym, but I end up doing things I have a hard time doing while the kid is at home instead.</description>

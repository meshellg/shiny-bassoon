                    <div class="post-description">
                        <p>A couple of weeks ago I filled out the form on the Children&rsquo;s Aid Society website indicating an interest to become a foster home. They sent back a message checking in with me, asking whether I was aware of the different religious and cultural based foster agencies in the city, and confirmed whether we wanted to proceed with them (we do).</p>

<p>So now we wait. Our next step is arranging a mutually amicable phone conversation - which I&rsquo;m already nervous about, but also ready to do anytime. I&rsquo;m not sure what the questions will be, but we&rsquo;ll see! I am excited. I am nervous. I am curious.</p>

<p>Even before I had our son I knew that one day I wanted to foster or adopt. I feel like our little family is perfect just the way it is, but I think that feeling would apply no matter what. But I would like to be part of helping kids have a safe supportive home while their parents or families are working through some stuff. So hopefully we get approved to proceed, or realize early on (before being placed with a child) that it&rsquo;s really not for us - either through talking with more foster parents, or as we go through the training.</p>

<p>I feel like I&rsquo;m in that strange middle space where I&rsquo;m filled with what ifs and too much information and simultaneously not enough information. I&rsquo;m reading people&rsquo;s experiences, and reading people&rsquo;s opinions, and blogs and all of that, but I still don&rsquo;t know what it will be like. Before becoming a parent, I read a bunch of people&rsquo;s experiences, I played with the idea in my head, I consumed all the information I could handle, and while that helped prepare me, everything changed the moment we actually met our son. That said, I realize previous experience should remind me to remain flexible and curious.</p>

<p>The thing I&rsquo;m finding surprisingly difficult is finding secular support communities for fostering, even locally. Perhaps we&rsquo;ll find it while we&rsquo;re actually doing things, but perhaps we will have to build our own. (though I am already getting ahead of myself.)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m hoping to post something regularly about the process and what we&rsquo;re learning.</p>

      <description>A couple of weeks ago I filled out the form on the Children&amp;rsquo;s Aid Society website indicating an interest to become a foster home. They sent back a message checking in with me, asking whether I was aware of the different religious and cultural based foster agencies in the city, and confirmed whether we wanted to proceed with them (we do).
So now we wait. Our next step is arranging a mutually amicable phone conversation - which I&amp;rsquo;m already nervous about, but also ready to do anytime.</description>

      <description>This morning after my partner left for work, we quickly got ready to get outside and go to the forest nearby. We&amp;rsquo;re lucky to hour our little forest, and I feel grateful to say things like &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s visit our trees&amp;rdquo; on a regular basis. There was so much to learn and so much to do. We walked hand in hand for most of the trip to the park, but once we got past the traffic gates I let him go and he asked if he could run.</description>
